# lnd - lightning network daemon

This repo is preliminary work on a lightning network peer to peer node and wallet.

It currently is being designed for testnet-L, a test network where all* txids are normalized.  This fixes malleability but isn't something that can be cleanly done to the existing bitcoin network.

It is not yet functional, but we hope to have a proof of concept on testnet-L soon.
