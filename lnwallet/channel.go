//  * .SignNextCommitment()
//    * Called one one wishes to sign the next commitment, either initiating a
//      new state update, or responding to a received commitment.
//  * .ReceiveNewCommitment()

//  * .RevokeCurrentCommitment()
//    * Revokes the current commitment. Should be called directly after
//      receiving a new commitment.
//  * .ReceiveRevocation()
//   * Processes a revocation from the remote party. If successful creates a
