// heuristic. This means that given a threshold to allocate to automatic
// channel establishment, the heuristic will attempt to favor connecting to
// nodes which already have a set amount of links, selected by sampling from a
// power law distribution. The attachment is non-linear in that it favors
// nodes with a higher in-degree but less so that regular linear preferential
// attachment. As a result, this creates smaller and less clusters than regular
// linear preferential attachment.

// in/out of the node available via its open channels) and utilize the
