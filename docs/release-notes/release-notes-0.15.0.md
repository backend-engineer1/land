# Release Notes

## Security

* [Misconfigured ZMQ
  setup now gets reported](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5710).

## `lncli`

* Add [auto-generated command-line completions](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4177) 
  for Fish shell.  

* Add [chan_point flag](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6152)
  to closechannel command.

* Add [private status](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6167)
  to pendingchannels response.

## Bug Fixes

* [Fixed an inactive invoice subscription not removed from invoice
  registry](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6053). When an invoice
  subscription is created and canceled immediately, it could be left uncleaned
  due to the cancel signal is processed before the creation. It is now properly
  handled by moving creation before deletion.   

* When the block height+delta specified by a network message is greater than
  the gossiper's best height, it will be considered as premature and ignored.
  [These premature messages are now saved into a cache and processed once the
  height has reached.](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6054)

## Misc

* [An example systemd service file](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6033)
  for running lnd alongside a bitcoind service is now provided in
  `contrib/init/lnd.service`.

* [Allow disabling migrations if the database backend passed to `channeldb` was
  opened in read-only mode](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6084).

* [Disable compiler optimizations](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6105)
  when building `lnd-debug` and `lncli-debug`. It helps when stepping through the code
  with a debugger like Delve.
  
* A new command `lncli leaseoutput` was [added](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5964).

* [Consolidated many smaller docs/typo/trivial fixes from PRs that were stuck
  in review because of unmet contribution guideline
  requirements](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6080).

* [A nightly build of the `lnd` docker image is now created
  automatically](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6160).

## RPC Server

* [Add value to the field
  `remote_balance`](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/5931) in
  `pending_force_closing_channels` under `pendingchannels` whereas before was
  empty(zero).

## Documentation

* Improved instructions on [how to build lnd for mobile](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6085).
* [Log force-close related messages on "info" level](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/6124).

## Code Health
